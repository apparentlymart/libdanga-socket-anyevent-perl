=head1 NAME

Danga::Socket::AnyEvent - Danga::Socket reimplemented in terms of AnyEvent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # This will clobber the Danga::Socket namespace
  # with the new implementation.
  use Danga::Socket::AnyEvent;
  
  # Then just use Danga::Socket as normal.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an alternative implementation of L<Danga::Socket> that is
implemented in terms of L<AnyEvent>, an abstraction layer for
event loops. This allows Danga::Socket applications to run
in any event loop supported by AnyEvent, and allows Danga::Socket
applications to make use of AnyEvent-based libraries.

Loading this module will install a workalike set of functions
into the Danga::Socket package. It must therefore be loaded before
anything loads the real L<Danga::Socket>. If you try to load
this module after Danga::Socket has been loaded then it will
die.

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM Danga::Socket

Although this module aims to be a faithful recreation of the
features and interface of Danga::Socket, there are some known
differences:

=over

=item * The C<LoopTimeout> feature will only work if the caller
runs the event loop via C<Danga::Socket->EventLoop>; if a caller
runs the AnyEvent event loop directly, or if some other library
runs it, then the timeout will not take effect.

=item * The C<PostLoopCallback> feature behaves in a slightly
different way than in the stock Danga::Socket. It's currently
implemented via an AnyEvent idlewatcher that runs whenever
the event loop goes idle after running a Danga::Socket event.
This means that it will probably run at different times than
it would have in Danga::Socket's own event loops.

=item * The C<HaveEpoll> method will always return true, regardless
of what backend is actually implementing the event loop. Make
sure to use AnyEvent's L<EV> backend if you would like to use
Epoll/KQueue/etc rather than other, less efficient mechanisms.
